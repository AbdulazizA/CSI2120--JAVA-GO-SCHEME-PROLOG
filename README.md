# CSI2120-JAVA-GO-SCHEME-PROLOG

Major programming paradigms:
object-oriented, imperative, logic, functional. Related programming languages, their essential properties and typical applications. Programming in imperative, logic and functional languages. Influence of programming paradigms on problem solving and program design strategies. An overview of other paradigms, such as constraint-based, rule-based and event-driven programming.
